Someone suggested to me that I should do the Euler Project problems from https://projecteuler.net/ in order to keep my python knowledge fresh.

I wanted to make aprogram to grab the problem descriptions and create files with the problem description as a comment. Right now, I have only done python, but other languages shouldn't be a problem.

To use:

* clone this repository
* create python subdirectory
* run the get_problems.py script
